HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a protocol for secure communication over the internet. HTTPS is essentially a combination of the standard HTTP protocol and the SSL/TLS encryption protocol.

Here's a breakdown of how HTTPS works:

**1** When a user enters a website's URL that uses HTTPS, the user's browser sends a request to the website's server.

**2** The website's server responds with a digital certificate, which contains the website's public key, as well as some other information about the website, such as its name and the certificate's issuer.

**3** The user's browser checks the certificate's issuer and expiration date, and then verifies the website's public key.

**4** If the website's public key is valid, the user's browser generates a random symmetric encryption key, which it uses to encrypt all communication with the website.

**5** The user's browser sends the encrypted symmetric key to the website's server.

**6** The website's server uses its private key to decrypt the symmetric key.

**7** From this point on, all communication between the user's browser and the website is encrypted using the symmetric key.

**8** This encryption protects against eavesdropping and ensures that any data that is transmitted between the user's browser and the website remains private and secure.

In summary, HTTPS provides an encrypted and secure connection between a user's browser and a website's server, which ensures the privacy and integrity of the data being transmitted.

## HTTP Methods

HTTP methods are a critical aspect of the HTTP protocol, which is the foundation of the World Wide Web. HTTP methods are used to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource, such as a web page, image, or other file, on a web server.

There are several HTTP methods, each of which has a specific purpose:

**1** GET: The GET method is used to retrieve a resource from the server. When a user clicks on a link or enters a URL in their browser, a GET request is sent to the server, and the server responds with the requested resource.

**2** POST: The POST method is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource. When a user submits a form on a website, the form data is sent to the server using a POST request.

**3** PUT: The PUT method is used to update an existing resource on the server. For example, a user might use a PUT request to update their profile information on a website.

**4** DELETE: The DELETE method is used to delete a resource on the server. For example, a user might use a DELETE request to delete a file or image on a website.

**5** HEAD: The HEAD method is similar to the GET method, but it only retrieves the headers of a resource, not the full resource itself. This is useful for checking the status of a resource without actually downloading it.

**6** OPTIONS: The OPTIONS method is used to retrieve information about the communication options available for a resource, such as the allowed HTTP methods or supported content types.

**7** TRACE: The TRACE method is used to retrieve a diagnostic trace of the requests and responses between the client and the server. This method is primarily used for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

Each HTTP method has a specific use case, and it is important for developers to use the appropriate method for the task at hand. Using the wrong method can result in errors or security vulnerabilities. Additionally, certain methods, such as PUT and DELETE, can have significant consequences if used improperly, so developers must take care when using them. Overall, HTTP methods are an essential part of web development, and understanding their purpose and proper use is critical for creating secure and effective web applications
