## Intro

As a self-taught web developer, I have faced several challenges that have forced me to learn by doing. These challenges have required me to enhance my skills, work hard, and find creative solutions to problems.

## Number 1

The first challenge I faced was the lack of structure and guidance in the learning process. Without formal education in web development (I am no bootcamp grad), I had to rely on online resources and tutorials to build my knowledge base. This challenge forced me to become self-reliant and develop problem-solving skills that, I now realise, are essential in the software development industry. 

I had to learn how to research effectively and filter through vast amounts of information to find the resources I needed. This skill has helped me become a more efficient and effective developer, allowing me to find solutions to complex problems quickly. One of the key areas where I have had a steep learning curve is reading documentation. This has been a vital skill to develop.

## Number 2

The second challenge was the lack of accountability and feedback. Learning on my own meant that I had to be my own critic and identify areas where I needed improvement. I had to develop a keen eye for detail and learn how to self-evaluate my work critically. This skill has made me a more thorough and detail-oriented developer, ensuring that my code is high-quality and meets the required standards.

As a self-taught developer, I also faced the challenge of keeping up with the rapidly changing technology landscape. This challenge forced me to become a lifelong learner and continually improve my skills. I had to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies, which has made me an adaptable and versatile developer. I can easily switch between programming languages and frameworks, and I am always eager to learn new things.

## Number 3

Another significant challenge I faced was gaining credibility in the eyes of employers. Many companies prefer candidates with formal education and training, which can make it difficult for self-taught developers to stand out. This challenge has forced me to develop a strong portfolio and demonstrate my skills through personal projects. It also made me more resilient and determined to succeed, which has helped me persevere through difficult projects and challenging work situations.

## Number 4

The lack of professional networks and connections was another challenge I faced. However, this challenge forced me to become more proactive and develop networking skills. I learned how to attend events, connect with other developers, and showcase my work effectively. This has helped me build a strong professional network and has given me access to job opportunities that I might not have had otherwise.

## Number 5

Lastly, as a self-taught developer, I had to learn how to work independently and self-motivate effectively. This challenge forced me to develop strong time management skills and learn how to prioritize tasks effectively. I also had to learn how to be self-motivated and stay focused on my goals. This has helped me become a more productive developer who can work efficiently and effectively with minimal supervision.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, being a self-taught web developer has presented me with several challenges that have ultimately made me a better developer than my peers. These challenges have forced me to become self-reliant, develop unique skills, and become an adaptable and versatile developer. While it has not been easy, I believe that these challenges have given me a unique perspective and set of skills that have helped me stand out in a competitive industry.
