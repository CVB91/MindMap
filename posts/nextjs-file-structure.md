## Next.js File Structure explained

Next.js is a popular open-source framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) React applications. It provides a simple and flexible file structure for organizing your codebase. Here's a breakdown of the typical file structure in a Next.js application:

**pages**: This directory contains your application's pages. Every .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file that's placed inside this directory becomes a route in your application. For example, a file called pages/about.js would create a route at http://localhost:3000/about.

**public**: This directory is used for static assets like images, fonts, and other files that are served directly to the browser. For example, if you have an image called logo.png in the public directory, you can use it in your code like this: <img src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" />.

**components**: This directory contains your application's reusable UI components. You can create as many subdirectories as you like to organize your components in a logical way.

**styles**: This directory is used for global stylesheets, such as a global.css file that applies styles to your entire application. You can also create per-component stylesheets and import them as needed.

**utils**: This directory contains utility functions that are used throughout your application. For example, you might have a file called api.js that contains functions for making API requests.

**pages/api**: This directory is used for API routes. Files in this directory become API endpoints that you can use to fetch data or perform other server-side tasks.

**.next**: This directory is generated by Next.js and contains build artifacts like compiled JavaScript and CSS files. You generally don't need to interact with this directory directly.

Overall, the file structure in a Next.js application is designed to be easy to understand and flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of project types and sizes.
